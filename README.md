## FAQs

_Is this a serious problem?_

Yeah. I waste a lot of time online. Please stop judging.

_Will this extension work for me?_

Probably not, this extension hardcoded the class names of HTML elements, which obviously change. This extension is pretty fragile and will likely break for you. Don't send hate mail.

_Then why are you sharing this?_

Good question. Maybe, it will be a helpful reference if you also want to build something similar. If you do, send me a message. I would love to hear about it.
